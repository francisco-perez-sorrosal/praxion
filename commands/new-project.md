description: Scaffold a greenfield Claude-ready Python project and onboard it to Praxion.
allowed-tools: [Bash, Read, Write, Edit, Glob, Grep, AskUserQuestion, Task, mcp__chub__*]
---

Onboard the current (freshly scaffolded) directory. Ask one question first, show the user *how* Praxion is driven (orchestrator + subagents), frame the build as a pipeline task so they watch the orchestrator in action, then — once the codebase exists — run `/init`, append the three Praxion blocks (Agent Pipeline + Compaction Guidance + Behavioral Contract) idempotently, generate a per-run trail map, and hand off to `/onboard-project` (which applies the remaining surfaces — git hooks, merge drivers, `.ai-state/` skeleton, `.claude/settings.json` toggles) before the user runs `/co` to commit. **Greenfield and existing-project paths converge on the same end state**: this command is the existing-project counterpart of `/onboard-project`'s Phase 6 ("CLAUDE.md blocks"); both produce byte-identical CLAUDE.md sections.

## §Guard

Before anything else, verify the filesystem shape. The bash layer is supposed to have left a scaffolded-but-empty directory — if any of these checks fail, print the guarded-abort message and stop.

Run these four checks from the project root:

1. `test -d .git` — the directory is a git repo.
2. `grep -q '^# AI assistants$' .gitignore && grep -q '^\.ai-work/$' .gitignore` — the AI-assistants block is present.
3. `test -d .claude && [ -z "$(ls -A .claude 2>/dev/null)" ]` — `.claude/` exists and is empty.
4. `! test -e src || [ -z "$(ls -A src 2>/dev/null)" ]` — `src/` is absent, or is an empty directory.

If any check fails, abort with:

> This directory doesn't look like a freshly-scaffolded Praxion greenfield project. `/new-project` expects to run inside a directory produced by `new_project.sh` (a `.git/` repo with the AI-assistants `.gitignore` block, an empty `.claude/`, and no `src/` tree yet). If you meant to onboard an existing project, run `/onboard-project` instead.

Exit without writing anything.

## §Flow

When the guard passes, follow these steps in order. Each step is a contract — tactics are your call, but the shape is fixed.

**Phase gates.** The thirteen steps below group into eight phases (Phase 1 = step 1; Phase 2 = step 2; Phase 3 = steps 3–4; Phase 4 = step 5, decomposed into sub-steps 5a–5e for the per-subagent previews; Phase 5 = steps 6–8; Phase 6 = steps 9–10; Phase 7 = step 11; Phase 8 = steps 12–13). **Between phases**, fire the `AskUserQuestion` gates defined in §Phase Gates so the user sees and acknowledges each phase before it runs. **Within Phase 4**, additional sub-gates 4a–4e fire before each subagent in the pipeline so the user previews what file(s) will appear (or what in-chat output to expect) before any work runs. Once the user picks `Run all rest` at any gate (top-level or sub-gate), suppress every subsequent gate — including remaining sub-gates — for the rest of this command run.

1. **Ask the single content question FIRST.** Use `AskUserQuestion` with the exact prompt: `What would you like to build? Press enter for the default (mini coding agent with web UI), or describe your own project.` The question precedes `/init` so CLAUDE.md ends up reflecting the user's actual choice once the codebase exists. *(Phase 1 — no preceding gate; this question IS the entry point.)*

2. **Print the orchestrator preamble to chat.** First, fire **GATE 2** per §Phase Gates. Then copy the content between the `PRAXION-ORCHESTRATOR-START` and `PRAXION-ORCHESTRATOR-END` sentinel markers in §How Claude drives Praxion and print it verbatim — *before* the pipeline runs. The user should learn the model *before* watching it execute.

3. **Branch on the answer.** First, fire **GATE 3** per §Phase Gates. Then branch:
   - Empty, `default`, `yes`, `y`, `ok` (case-insensitive) → §Default App — Pipeline Framing.
   - Any non-trivial description → §Custom App — Pipeline Framing.

4. **Show the pipeline-framed prompt you're about to execute.** Print the wrapped task (from §Default App — Pipeline Framing or the custom variant) in a fenced block, preceded by: `Here's the task I'm about to run through the pipeline — watch how Claude orchestrates researcher → architect → planner → implementer + test-engineer → verifier.` The shape of this prompt is the teaching.

5. **Execute the pipeline.** First, fire **GATE 4** per §Phase Gates (the umbrella headline that announces the whole pipeline). Then act as orchestrator — delegate to Praxion subagents via the `Task` tool per `rules/swe/swe-agent-coordination-protocol.md`. Use the **Standard-tier pipeline with full delegation checklists** for architect and planner — the seed's pedagogical goal is to show every canonical artifact Praxion produces, so the user's first observation matches what real feature work will later produce. The one seed-specific trim is formal SPEC archival (no REQ IDs, no `.ai-state/specs/SPEC_*.md`) and the verifier's written report (the seed's in-chat summary is enough). Each delegation is wrapped in its own sub-gate (4a–4e per §Phase Gates) — fire the sub-gate *before* invoking the subagent so the user sees what file(s) will appear before any work runs. Sub-gates honor the same one-way `Run all rest` flag set at any earlier gate, so users who opted out of pauses are not re-prompted.
   - **5a.** Fire **GATE 4a**, then delegate to `researcher` — fetch current Claude Agent SDK + `uv` + FastAPI signatures via `external-api-docs` (chub). Output: `.ai-work/<task-slug>/RESEARCH_FINDINGS.md` (structured doc with API summaries, version checks, capability gaps).
   - **5b.** Fire **GATE 4b**, then delegate to `systems-architect` — full delegation checklist. Outputs: `.ai-work/<task-slug>/SYSTEMS_PLAN.md` (trade-offs + module-shape + dependency-direction), `.ai-state/ARCHITECTURE.md` (architect-facing design target), `docs/architecture.md` (developer-facing navigation guide, Built components only), and at least one ADR draft in `.ai-state/decisions/drafts/` pinned to the one-way `src/agent/` → `src/web/` dependency rule (leaving the SSE-over-WebSockets decision as genuinely novel material for L5 later). Use the fragment-filename scheme from `rules/swe/adr-conventions.md` and include the standard MADR body (Context / Decision / Considered Options / Consequences).
   - **5c.** Fire **GATE 4c**, then delegate to `implementation-planner` — full three-doc model on first invocation. Outputs: `.ai-work/<task-slug>/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` (3–5 step decomposition; the canonical ordered step list), `.ai-work/<task-slug>/WIP.md` (live step-tracking the implementer updates as it works), `.ai-work/<task-slug>/LEARNINGS.md` (cross-session insights — seed it with at least the planner's decomposition decisions and any gotchas surfaced by the architect so the file is not empty).
   - **5d.** Fire **GATE 4d**, then delegate to `implementer` + `test-engineer` concurrently on disjoint file sets. Output: code under `src/agent/`, `src/web/`, `tests/` (full file inventory in §Default App Spec).
   - **5e.** Fire **GATE 4e**, then delegate to `verifier` — one-paragraph acceptance check against §Default App Spec invariants (skip the formal report for the seed). Output: in-chat pass/fail summary.
   Ephemeral plan docs live in `.ai-work/<task-slug>/`; persistent design docs live in `.ai-state/` (architecture + ADR drafts) and `docs/` (developer-facing architecture guide). The seed writes every canonical artifact so the user's first pipeline observation includes the full document set — the subsequent `/co` will commit them.

6. **Run the SDK smoke check** per §SDK smoke check. First, fire **GATE 5** per §Phase Gates. If the probe fails, follow the recovery path (re-fetch chub, introspect installed package, regenerate the affected file, submit `chub_feedback`).

7. **Run the test gate.** `uv sync && uv run pytest -q`. If `uv` is absent, see §Prereq Behaviors.

8. **Regenerate the `.gitignore` Python block.** Append (without duplicating) `__pycache__/`, `.venv/`, `*.egg-info/`, `.pytest_cache/`. Do NOT exclude `uv.lock` — it stays tracked.

9. **Invoke `/init` NOW.** First, fire **GATE 6** per §Phase Gates. Then invoke `/init` — the codebase exists and reflects the user's choice, so `/init`'s CLAUDE.md describes reality. Do not author CLAUDE.md by hand.

10. **Append the three Praxion blocks idempotently.** Per §Init idempotency, check `CLAUDE.md` for each of three headings independently — `## Agent Pipeline`, `## Compaction Guidance`, `## Behavioral Contract`. For each missing heading, append the corresponding block verbatim from §Agent Pipeline Block, §Compaction Guidance Block, §Behavioral Contract Block respectively. Each block is guarded by its own predicate; one missing block does not force re-appending the others. **Smooth-integration contract:** if all three append, `/onboard-project`'s Phase 6 will be a complete no-op when the user runs it next.

11. **Generate the mushi doc LAST.** First, fire **GATE 7** per §Phase Gates. Then generate the mushi doc — file anchors (§Mushi Doc Spec) must be computed against the final on-disk state, so this step follows everything that writes source code.

12. **Stage the scaffold.** `git add -A` (the `.gitignore` keeps `.env` and `.ai-work/` out). Do NOT run `git commit`. *(Phase 8 — no preceding gate; the staging+handoff is short and the exit message itself is the natural pause.)*

13. **Print the exit handoff** (verbatim wording at the end of this file).

## §Phase Contracts

Mirror of `/onboard-project`'s §Flow contracts table — what each Phase produces and the predicate that makes it idempotent. Phases here are coarser-grained than `/onboard-project`'s (greenfield is more pedagogical and the seed pipeline output is feature-driven), but the **CLAUDE.md block surfaces (§Init idempotency, §Phase 6 in `/onboard-project`) are byte-identical**.

| Phase | Action | Predicate (skip if already done) |
|-------|--------|----------------------------------|
| 1 | Single content question (`AskUserQuestion`) — what to build | None — entry point |
| 2 | Print orchestrator preamble | None — read-only chat output |
| 3 | Branch on answer (default vs custom) + show pipeline-framed prompt | None — per-invocation framing |
| 4 | Execute Standard-tier pipeline (researcher → architect → planner → implementer ∥ test-engineer → verifier) | None — produces feature artifacts each run |
| 5 | SDK smoke check + test gate (`uv sync && uv run pytest -q`) + Python `.gitignore` block | Per §Idempotency Predicates: Python block detected by `# Python` header |
| 6 | `/init` (if `CLAUDE.md` missing) + idempotent append of three blocks | Per §Init idempotency — three independent heading-detection predicates |
| 7 | Generate the per-run mushi doc | None — file is regenerated each run by design |
| 8 | Stage scaffold + print exit handoff (recommends `/onboard-project` then `/co`) | None — terminal phase |

The §Guard at flow-start ensures the directory is in greenfield-shape (empty `.claude/`, no `src/`, AI-assistants `.gitignore` block from `new_project.sh`) — re-runs on a non-greenfield directory abort with a redirect to `/onboard-project`.

## §Phase Gates

The seed onboarding is the densest pedagogical moment in a Praxion user's whole journey, and the default §Flow runs it end-to-end without pause. To let the user *learn* the orchestrator + subagent pattern instead of just *watching* it whoosh by, fire an `AskUserQuestion` gate at every phase boundary defined below. Each gate explains what's about to happen *before* it happens; the user clicks `Continue` to proceed (or opts out via `Run all rest`).

**Escape hatch (one-way).** Each gate offers two options: `Continue` and `Run all rest`. If the user picks `Run all rest`, set an internal "no-more-gates" flag for the remainder of this command run and skip every subsequent gate without asking. The flag is one-way — once set, it persists until the command exits. This honors users who have run the onboarding before and want it to play through.

**Fallback.** If `AskUserQuestion` is unavailable (tool error, headless invocation), print the headline as a chat message and proceed without blocking. Do not fail the onboarding because a gate cannot fire.

**Format.** Every gate uses these `AskUserQuestion` parameters:

- `header` — `"Next?"`
- `question` — the headline from the table below (forward-looking; describes the phase about to start, not the one just finished)
- `multiSelect` — `false`
- `options` — exactly two:
  - `{ label: "Continue", description: "Proceed with this phase. I'll pause again before the next." }`
  - `{ label: "Run all rest", description: "Skip remaining gates and run the rest autonomously." }`

**Phase-to-gate map.** Phase 1 (the content question) is itself an `AskUserQuestion`, so it needs no preceding gate. Phase 8 (stage + exit handoff) is a short close-out where the final message is itself the stopping point, so it also has no gate. The six phase gates between (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7), plus five sub-gates inside Phase 4 (4a–4e — one per subagent in the headline pipeline run, so the user previews each agent's outputs before it executes), are:

| Gate | Fires before §Flow step | Headline (use verbatim as `question`) |
|------|------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| 2 | step 2 (orchestrator preamble) | `Phase 2 of 7: I'll explain how Claude drives Praxion — orchestrator routes plain-English tasks to specialist subagents (researcher / architect / planner / implementer / test-engineer / verifier). Reading this once now means you won't need to memorize slash commands later. Continue?` |
| 3 | step 3 (branch + framed prompt) | `Phase 3 of 7: I'll show you the exact English task I'm about to feed the orchestrator. The shape of this prompt — concrete behaviors + acceptance criteria + explicit pipeline invocation — is the pattern you'll reuse forever. Continue?` |
| 4 | step 5 (execute pipeline) | `Phase 4 of 7: HEADLINE EVENT. I delegate to researcher → systems-architect → implementation-planner → implementer + test-engineer (concurrent) → verifier. I'll pause before each subagent so you can see what file it will produce. Continue?` |
| 4a | step 5a (researcher) | `Pipeline step 1 of 5: researcher. Fetches current Claude Agent SDK / uv / FastAPI signatures via context-hub (the chub MCP). Produces .ai-work/<task-slug>/RESEARCH_FINDINGS.md — API summaries, version checks, capability notes — so downstream agents design against real signatures, not training-data guesses. Continue?` |
| 4b | step 5b (systems-architect) | `Pipeline step 2 of 5: systems-architect. Full delegation checklist on first invocation — this is Praxion's complete architecture artifact set, appearing on your screen for the first time. Produces .ai-work/<task-slug>/SYSTEMS_PLAN.md (trade-offs + module shape), .ai-state/ARCHITECTURE.md (architect-facing design target; persists across every future feature), docs/architecture.md (developer-facing navigation guide), and an ADR draft in .ai-state/decisions/drafts/ pinning the one-way src/agent/ → src/web/ dependency rule. The ADR starts as a dec-draft-<hash> fragment and is promoted to a stable dec-NNN at merge-to-main. Continue?` |
| 4c | step 5c (implementation-planner) | `Pipeline step 3 of 5: implementation-planner. Full three-doc model on first invocation. Produces .ai-work/<task-slug>/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md (the canonical ordered step list), WIP.md (live step-tracking the implementer updates as it works), and LEARNINGS.md (cross-session insights — seeded with the planner's decomposition decisions so the file is not empty). This is the full planner artifact set you will see on every future feature. Continue?` |
| 4d | step 5d (implementer + test-engineer) | `Pipeline step 4 of 5: implementer + test-engineer running concurrently on disjoint file sets. Writes src/agent/, src/web/, and tests/ — real code lands in your project tree. Watch your editor's file tree refresh as files appear. Continue?` |
| 4e | step 5e (verifier) | `Pipeline step 5 of 5: verifier. Checks the three §Default App acceptance criteria — agent→web import isolation, SAFE_COMMANDS shape, pytest green. Compact-seed output is a one-paragraph in-chat report; the formal VERIFICATION_REPORT.md is reserved for full-tier features. Continue?` |
| 5 | step 6 (SDK smoke check) | `Phase 5 of 7: I verify the Claude Agent SDK import surface (chub docs sometimes drift from the installed package), run the test suite via uv, and lock down the .gitignore Python block. Continue?` |
| 6 | step 9 (/init) | `Phase 6 of 7: I run /init so CLAUDE.md describes the code that ACTUALLY exists (not what I imagined), then idempotently append three Praxion blocks — Agent Pipeline (how to delegate), Compaction Guidance (what to preserve when chat compacts), and Behavioral Contract (Surface Assumptions / Register Objection / Stay Surgical / Simplicity First). Each is guarded by its own heading-detection predicate. Continue?` |
| 7 | step 11 (mushi doc) | `Phase 7 of 7: I generate onboarding_for_mushi_busy_ppl.md — your project-specific map with a happy-path Mermaid diagram, file inventory, lesson ladder, and PoC-to-production journey. Continue?` |

**Don't paraphrase the headlines.** Copy each cell verbatim into the `question` field — they're sized to teach the user *why* each phase exists, not just *what* it does, and the wording was chosen so the seven gates form a coherent narrative across the run.

## §What is Praxion

Canonical paragraph. Enclosed between sentinel markers so the mushi-doc generation step can copy it verbatim by matching the markers. Do not paraphrase — copy the bytes between (but not including) the markers.

<!-- PRAXION-PARAGRAPH-START -->
Praxion is a toolbox that turns Claude Code into a disciplined engineering partner. It ships a curated set of skills, agents, rules, commands, and memory that wire Claude into a clean Understand → Plan → Verify workflow. As you work, the system researches external APIs, plans in small known-good increments, writes and runs tests, verifies its own output against acceptance criteria, and remembers what you've agreed on across sessions — so you spend your attention on deciding what to build next, not on hand-holding the tools.
<!-- PRAXION-PARAGRAPH-END -->

## §How Claude drives Praxion

Orchestrator preamble. Same copy-verbatim rule as §What is Praxion — printed to chat in Flow step 2, and copied into the mushi doc as section 2.

<!-- PRAXION-ORCHESTRATOR-START -->
**You don't call Praxion subagents by name.** You write tasks in plain English, and Claude (the orchestrator) routes the work to the right specialists:

- **researcher** — explores docs, libraries, prior art, external APIs
- **systems-architect** — designs module shape, dependency direction, trade-offs
- **implementation-planner** — breaks a design into small, testable steps
- **implementer** — writes code for one step at a time
- **test-engineer** — writes tests; runs in parallel with the implementer when possible
- **verifier** — checks the result against explicit acceptance criteria

The pattern that triggers routing is a task written with **concrete behaviors + acceptance criteria + (when you want the full pipeline) an explicit "use Praxion's Standard-tier pipeline" invocation**. You speak English, Claude delegates. No `/command` memorization required.
<!-- PRAXION-ORCHESTRATOR-END -->

## §Default App — Pipeline Framing

When the user accepts the default, emit the following pipeline-framed task in chat (in a fenced block, preceded by the Flow-step-4 one-liner). Then execute it — you read this as the orchestrator and delegate to subagents via `Task`.

```
Build a minimal conversational coding agent for Python 3.11+ using the Claude Agent SDK.

Behaviors:
- An agent loop over user turns via the Claude Agent SDK (use symbols fetched from external-api-docs; do NOT guess SDK surface).
- Two starter tools: `read_file(path: str) -> str` (filesystem read) and `run_command(cmd: str) -> str` (safe-listed via a module-scope `SAFE_COMMANDS = frozenset({"ls", "pwd", "cat", "python"})` — first token not in the frozenset returns a refusal string, does not raise).
- A FastAPI POST `/chat` that streams the agent's response as Server-Sent Events, plus a minimal HTML page at `static/index.html` that POSTs and renders the stream.
- Strict one-way dependency: `src/agent/` imports nothing from `src/web/`; `src/web/` may import from `src/agent/`.
- One smoke test at `tests/test_agent.py` that constructs the agent without hitting the network.

Tech: Python 3.11+, uv for project management, Claude Agent SDK, FastAPI + sse-starlette (or current-doc equivalent), pytest.

Acceptance:
- `grep -r 'from src.web\|import src.web' src/agent/` returns no matches.
- `SAFE_COMMANDS` is a module-scope `frozenset` in `src/agent/tools.py`.
- `uv run pytest -q` passes on a fresh `uv sync` with only `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` optionally set.

Use Praxion's Standard-tier pipeline with the full delegation checklist for architect and planner (this is a seed app, so skip only SPEC archival and the verifier's formal written report — everything else fires):
- researcher fetches current Claude Agent SDK + uv + FastAPI signatures via external-api-docs
- systems-architect produces SYSTEMS_PLAN.md, .ai-state/ARCHITECTURE.md, docs/architecture.md, and one ADR draft in .ai-state/decisions/drafts/ for the one-way src/agent/ → src/web/ dependency rule (leave SSE-over-WebSockets as a future decision — it is tutorial material for a later lesson)
- implementation-planner decomposes into 3–5 steps and produces the full three-doc model: IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md + WIP.md + LEARNINGS.md (seeded with the planner's decomposition decisions)
- implementer + test-engineer run concurrently on disjoint file sets
- verifier checks the three acceptance criteria above and reports pass/fail in one paragraph (no written VERIFICATION_REPORT.md for the seed — that artifact is reserved for the first real feature, so L4 has something fresh to teach)
```

The shape of this prompt — specific behaviors, explicit acceptance, explicit pipeline invocation — is the pattern the user will reuse in the mushi-doc lessons.

## §Custom App — Pipeline Framing

When the user describes a non-trivial app (not empty, not a default-synonym), emit the SAME shape — **behaviors + tech + acceptance + explicit pipeline invocation** — with fields derived from their description. Ask at most one clarifying question if the description is missing any of: target language/framework, a concrete behavior, or an observable acceptance criterion. If all three are present, do not ask — build.

Example (user said: "I want a Discord bot that greets new members"):

```
Build a Discord bot in Python 3.11+ that greets new members.

Behaviors:
- Connects to a Discord guild via a bot token read from the `DISCORD_TOKEN` env var.
- On `member_join` event, posts a configurable greeting string in a configurable channel.
- Greeting string and channel id come from `config.toml` at project root; defaults do not leak any guild id.

Tech: Python 3.11+, uv, `discord.py` (or `hikari` if the user expresses a preference).

Acceptance:
- `uv run pytest -q` passes; tests cover (a) config parse, (b) greeting-string formatting, (c) dispatcher selects the right channel by id.
- No hardcoded tokens, channel ids, or guild ids in source.

Use Praxion's Standard-tier pipeline with the full delegation checklist for architect and planner (skip only SPEC archival and the verifier's written report for this seed). The architect produces SYSTEMS_PLAN.md + .ai-state/ARCHITECTURE.md + docs/architecture.md + one ADR draft for the defining trade-off; the planner produces the full three-doc model (IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md + WIP.md + LEARNINGS.md).
```

The custom branch still runs every step of §Flow (orchestrator preamble, pipeline framing shown and executed, `/init` after code exists, mushi doc last) and produces the same full artifact set (SYSTEMS_PLAN + ARCHITECTURE + docs/architecture + ADR draft + three-doc planner model). The only lesson-ladder difference is that **L1 and L2 are tailored to the user's app** (new tool analog, refactor analog) while **L3–L7 remain generic** — see §Five-to-Seven Lessons. Tailored count is fixed at 2 regardless of final ladder size (5–7 total).

If Claude cannot produce a concrete `src/<path>:<line>` anchor for a tailored lesson (e.g., user described a Haskell library with no `src/` tree), fall back to the generic L1/L2 and note the fallback in the mushi doc's troubleshooting line.

## §Default App Spec

Structural reference — the pipeline (§Flow step 5) must produce these paths and honor these invariants. The architect agent honoring this spec runs per its standing contract in `agents/systems-architect.md` (full delegation checklist on first invocation), with the seed-specific tightening described in §Default App — Pipeline Framing.

**File inventory (paths are mandatory):**

- `src/agent/__init__.py` — package marker.
- `src/agent/core.py` — agent entry point using symbols from `claude_agent_sdk` (or the current equivalent module path from chub). Exports one constructor/factory.
- `src/agent/tools.py` — two tools: `read_file`, `run_command`. See safe-list invariant.
- `src/agent/prompts.py` — system prompt(s) as plain constants.
- `src/web/__init__.py` — package marker.
- `src/web/app.py` — FastAPI POST `/chat` streaming SSE. Imports agent entry from `src.agent.core`.
- `src/web/static/index.html` — minimal chat UI.
- `tests/__init__.py` — package marker.
- `tests/test_agent.py` — smoke test (no network).
- `pyproject.toml` — uv-managed, deps per fetched docs.
- `.env.example` — `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=` placeholder.

**Dependency-direction invariant:** `src/agent/` imports nothing from `src/web/`; `src/web/` may import from `src/agent/`. Verify with `grep -r 'from src.web\|import src.web' src/agent/` → zero matches.

**Safe-list invariant for `run_command`:** module-scope `SAFE_COMMANDS = frozenset({"ls", "pwd", "cat", "python"})`; first-token comparison; refusal returns a plain `str` and does not raise.

**FastAPI `/chat` shape:** POST with `{"message": str}` body, `text/event-stream` response.

**Smoke test:** constructs the agent without hitting the network (mock/stub per fetched doc).

**`.ai-state/` writes are expected** during the seed build — `.ai-state/ARCHITECTURE.md` (architect-facing design target) and at least one ADR draft under `.ai-state/decisions/drafts/<fragment>.md` (pinning the one-way `src/agent/` → `src/web/` dependency rule). The developer-facing `docs/architecture.md` is also produced. All three land in the working tree and are staged by the exit handoff's `git add -A`, so `/co` commits them with the rest of the scaffold. The one-but-not-the-other pedagogical choice here: the seed is the user's *first* view of Praxion's architecture-artifact set, so producing them surfaces the philosophy early; formal SPEC archival and `VERIFICATION_REPORT.md` stay deferred to L4 so a later lesson has genuinely novel material.

## §SDK smoke check

After `uv add claude-agent-sdk` succeeds, before or immediately after writing `src/agent/core.py`, probe the import surface:

```
uv run python -c "from claude_agent_sdk import ClaudeSDKClient, query, tool; print('ok')"
```

If it prints `ok`, proceed. If the import fails with `ImportError` / `ModuleNotFoundError` / `AttributeError`, the fetched chub doc has drifted from the installed SDK. Recovery:

1. Re-read the fetched chub entry; request it again and prefer entries marked `official` or `maintainer`.
2. Inspect the installed package: `uv run python -c "import claude_agent_sdk; print(dir(claude_agent_sdk))"` and pick the actually-present public symbols.
3. Regenerate `src/agent/core.py` against those symbols.
4. Submit `chub_feedback` with `vote: "down"`, `label: "outdated"`, naming the missing symbol and the installed SDK version. Append the identity suffix per the `external-api-docs` skill.

Never copy symbol names from this file into generated code — this file deliberately does not pin them.

## §Init idempotency

`/new-project` appends **three** blocks to `CLAUDE.md`: §Agent Pipeline Block, §Compaction Guidance Block, §Behavioral Contract Block. Each is guarded by an independent heading-detection predicate so re-runs are no-ops per block.

For each of the three blocks, before appending:

```
grep -q '^## <BLOCK_HEADING>$' CLAUDE.md
```

…where `<BLOCK_HEADING>` is `Agent Pipeline`, `Compaction Guidance`, or `Behavioral Contract` respectively.

- Exit `0` (match found) → block already exists; skip the append.
- Exit non-zero → append the block verbatim from its §-named source section.

These predicates mirror `/onboard-project`'s §Phase 6 byte-for-byte. Re-running either command — or running both — never duplicates a section. If `/new-project` lands all three blocks during greenfield, `/onboard-project`'s Phase 6 becomes a complete no-op (every per-block predicate hits) — the smooth-integration contract.

## §Mushi Doc Spec

Generate `<project-root>/onboarding_for_mushi_busy_ppl.md` with these nine sections in this exact order:

1. **Canonical Praxion paragraph** — copied verbatim (byte-for-byte) from between the `PRAXION-PARAGRAPH-START` and `PRAXION-PARAGRAPH-END` sentinel markers in §What is Praxion. Do not paraphrase.
2. **How Claude drives Praxion** — copied verbatim from between the `PRAXION-ORCHESTRATOR-START` and `PRAXION-ORCHESTRATOR-END` sentinel markers in §How Claude drives Praxion. Placed immediately after the canonical paragraph — the first thing the user reads after "what is Praxion" is "how I talk to it."
3. **TL;DR card** — exactly three lines: "what you have", "what you can do right now", "what to do next".
4. **Mermaid happy-path diagram** — ≤10 nodes per `rules/writing/diagram-conventions.md`. One concept only.
5. **What got created table** — columns `Artifact | Purpose | Edit when…`. One row per generated file. **Just-in-time verification:** `ls -la <path>` every row; do not ship a row whose path does not resolve.
6. **Five-to-seven lesson ladder** — `<details>` collapsibles, one per lesson, in the "Put this in Claude" four-bullet format defined in §Five-to-Seven Lessons. L6 is mandatory.
7. **Glossary collapsible** — short definitions for: Praxion, skill, agent, rule, command, **orchestrator**, **subagent**, pipeline, Understand/Plan/Verify, Claude Agent SDK, uv, `.ai-state/`, `.ai-work/`, `/co`, `/cop`, **ADR** (`dec-NNN`), **sentinel report**.
8. **Journey to Production** — heading `## From PoC to Production`. Open content (NOT a `<details>` — this is core, not optional depth). Eight rows in a milestone table (`Milestone | Trigger | Produces`) covering: (1) Working PoC + architecture baseline + first ADR = the seed already lands all three (`.ai-state/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/architecture.md`, and one ADR draft under `.ai-state/decisions/drafts/`), (2) Health audit via `sentinel` agent producing `.ai-state/SENTINEL_REPORT_*.md`, (3) Architecture *evolves* — each feature updates `.ai-state/ARCHITECTURE.md` + `docs/architecture.md` via `systems-architect`, (4) ADR fleet accumulates — each decision-worthy choice becomes a new draft in `.ai-state/decisions/drafts/` (promoted to stable `dec-NNN` at merge-to-main by `scripts/finalize_adrs.py`), (5) CI/CD via `cicd-engineer` producing `.github/workflows/*.yml`, (6) Deployment via `deployment` skill producing `compose.yaml` + `.ai-state/SYSTEM_DEPLOYMENT.md`, (7) First release via `/release` producing version bump + `CHANGELOG.md` + git tag, (8) Cross-session memory via `remember()` writing `.ai-state/memory.json`. Each `Trigger` cell shows the exact prompt or command. Each `Produces` cell names a real path the user will see. Close the section with a 6-step "Suggested order for this project" numbered list anchored to the just-generated app: iterate via L1–L7 (each feature evolves the architecture docs + may add an ADR) → sentinel audit at ~10 files → CI/CD before first user → deployment when ready to host → first release at stable behavior → record ADRs continuously as you go, never batched. The table mirrors `docs/getting-started.md#journey-poc-to-production` in shape; the language stack column reflects what was actually scaffolded (e.g., row 5 names `pyproject.toml` if uv was detected).
9. **What to read next** — three short bullets in this exact order: (1) "Run `/onboard-project` to apply the remaining onboarding surfaces — git hooks (ADR finalize, id-citation discipline), merge drivers for `.ai-state/memory.json` + `observations.jsonl`, `.ai-state/` skeleton, `.claude/settings.json` toggles. The greenfield scaffold leaves these for `/onboard-project` so both onboarding paths share one source of truth.", (2) "Run `/co` to make your first commit (or `/cop` for commit+push); both apply `rules/swe/vcs/git-conventions.md` automatically, so you don't hand-craft commit messages.", (3) "Open `docs/greenfield-onboarding.md` in the Praxion repo for the full greenfield walkthrough; `docs/existing-project-onboarding.md` covers the existing-project path that `/onboard-project` drives."

**File anchors:** every lesson references at least one concrete anchor of the form `src/<path>:<line>` that resolves to a real line. Generate the mushi doc after all source files are written so anchors are stable.

**Journey verification:** the eight milestones in section 8 must each name a concrete path the user can `ls` after triggering it (paths are aspirational at generation time — they will not exist in the freshly-scaffolded project, which is the point). Do not invent paths; cite the same paths used in `docs/getting-started.md` and the `## Agent Pipeline` block in `CLAUDE.md`.

## §Five-to-Seven Lessons

Each lesson in the mushi doc uses this exact four-bullet shape:

- **What you'll learn** — the Praxion concept or competency the lesson unlocks.
- **Put this in Claude** — a block-quoted, plain-English task the user copy-pastes into their next Claude session. Big enough to trigger orchestrator routing.
- **What will happen** — which subagents Claude will delegate to, and what they'll produce.
- **Expected touches** — concrete file anchors that will change.

Ship all seven by default; L1 / L2 / L7 may be omitted only if anchor generation fails (final ladder ≥ 5). **L6 is mandatory.**

### L1 — Add a new tool to the agent

- **What you'll learn:** how the orchestrator routes a multi-file feature through research → design → plan → paired implement+test → verify.
- **Put this in Claude:**
  > Add a tool called `list_dir(path: str) -> str` to the agent that returns the entries of a given directory, enforcing the same safe-list pattern as `run_command`. Apply Praxion's Standard-tier pipeline: research any relevant SDK conventions for tool registration, design the tool contract, decompose into steps, implement with paired tests, and verify the safe-list invariant still holds.
- **What will happen:** Claude spawns `researcher` (SDK conventions), `systems-architect` (tool contract + invariant reuse), `implementation-planner` (3-step decomposition), `implementer` + `test-engineer` in parallel (new tool + test), `verifier` (acceptance check).
- **Expected touches:** `src/agent/tools.py:<line-near-SAFE_COMMANDS>`, `tests/test_agent.py`, maybe `src/agent/prompts.py` (tool intro).

### L2 — Refactor the web layer safely

- **What you'll learn:** restructure code without changing behavior, using an isolated worktree so `main` never sees half-done state.
- **Put this in Claude:**
  > Refactor `src/web/app.py` into two modules: one for routes, one for the SSE streaming helper. Create a worktree for the refactor, preserve behavior (the existing smoke test must pass unchanged), and merge back only when tests are green.
- **What will happen:** Claude creates a worktree, then routes the refactor through the `refactoring` skill; `implementer` splits the module, `test-engineer` verifies no behavior change; merged back on green.
- **Expected touches:** `src/web/app.py:<line-of-POST-/chat>` → split into `src/web/routes.py` and `src/web/streaming.py`; `tests/test_agent.py` unchanged.

### L3 — Fetch current SDK docs before writing code

- **What you'll learn:** never guess an SDK signature — fetch the current doc first, even when Claude seems confident.
- **Put this in Claude:**
  > Before I extend the agent, I want a current summary of Claude Agent SDK's public API. Use context-hub (the external-api-docs skill) to fetch the latest Claude Agent SDK Python signatures, then produce a one-page cheat-sheet in this chat covering tool registration, hooks, and multi-turn sessions. No code changes — this is a read.
- **What will happen:** Claude spawns `researcher`, which invokes the `external-api-docs` skill (`mcp__chub__chub_search` + `mcp__chub__chub_get`), then summarizes in-chat.
- **Expected touches:** none (read-only). Your transcript now has a fresh cheat-sheet you can anchor `src/agent/core.py:<line-of-import>` against.

### L4 — Add a feature end-to-end with full quality gates

- **What you'll learn:** how a real feature *evolves* Praxion's persistent artifacts — the architecture docs from the seed get updated (not replaced), the next ADR joins the existing fleet, `VERIFICATION_REPORT.md` appears for the first time, and you see the full Plan → Implement → Verify traceability chain end-to-end.
- **Put this in Claude:**
  > Add a request-size gate to POST `/chat`: reject bodies larger than 4 KB with HTTP 413, and emit the accepted size as the first SSE event. Apply Praxion's Standard-tier pipeline in full — I want the architect to update the existing `.ai-state/ARCHITECTURE.md` and `docs/architecture.md` (do not rewrite them from scratch), the planner to produce a fresh `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`/`WIP.md`/`LEARNINGS.md` triad for this feature, paired implementer/test work, and a VERIFICATION_REPORT.md against explicit acceptance criteria. Leave the `.ai-work/` artifacts in place so I can read them.
- **What will happen:** full pipeline fires — `researcher` → `systems-architect` (updates `ARCHITECTURE.md` + `docs/architecture.md`, writes a fresh `SYSTEMS_PLAN.md`, adds a new ADR draft if the gate introduces a trade-off) → `implementation-planner` (fresh `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` + `WIP.md` + `LEARNINGS.md`) → `implementer` + `test-engineer` → `verifier` (NEW: `VERIFICATION_REPORT.md`).
- **Expected touches:** `src/web/app.py:<line-of-POST-/chat>`, `tests/test_agent.py`, updated `.ai-state/ARCHITECTURE.md`, updated `docs/architecture.md`, possibly a new `.ai-state/decisions/drafts/<fragment>.md`, and a fresh `.ai-work/<slug>/` directory with the full four-doc pipeline set + `VERIFICATION_REPORT.md`.

### L5 — Persist a second decision as an ADR

- **What you'll learn:** how ADRs accumulate as a project evolves — the seed already wrote your first ADR (the `src/agent/` → `src/web/` dependency rule), and this lesson grows the fleet. You'll see the fragment-filename-at-create scheme, understand that drafts under `.ai-state/decisions/drafts/` only promote to stable `dec-NNN` at merge-to-main, and watch `DECISIONS_INDEX.md` accumulate as decisions compound over the project's lifetime.
- **Put this in Claude:**
  > Record a decision: we chose Server-Sent Events for POST `/chat` streaming over WebSockets and long-polling because SSE gives simpler server code and automatic reconnect. Write this as a new ADR following `rules/swe/adr-conventions.md` (MADR frontmatter + Context / Decision / Considered Options / Consequences) — use the fragment-filename scheme (`<YYYYMMDD-HHMM>-<user>-<branch>-<slug>.md` under `.ai-state/decisions/drafts/`) with `id: dec-draft-<hash>` and `status: proposed`, since we have not merged to main yet. The cross-reference-aware finalize script will promote it later.
- **What will happen:** Claude writes `.ai-state/decisions/drafts/<fragment>.md` with full frontmatter + body. The draft sits alongside the seed's dependency-rule ADR in `drafts/` until merge-to-main, at which point `scripts/finalize_adrs.py` renames both to stable `dec-NNN` files and regenerates `DECISIONS_INDEX.md`.
- **Expected touches:** `.ai-state/decisions/drafts/<fragment>-sse-over-websockets.md` (new draft). Anchored to `src/web/app.py:<line-of-streaming-return>`.

### L6 — Testing workflow (MANDATORY)

- **What you'll learn:** Praxion's testing rhythm — behavioral tests first, tight feedback loop via `pytest -q`, full suite green before a commit lands.
- **Put this in Claude:**
  > Extend `tests/test_agent.py` with a behavioral test that asserts `run_command("rm -rf /")` (or any first token outside the safe-list) returns the refusal string without raising. Then run the full pytest suite and report pass/fail. If the invariant is looser than I described, flag it — don't silently tighten it.
- **What will happen:** Claude spawns `test-engineer`, adds the behavioral test, runs `uv run pytest -q`, reports results. If the invariant is loose, Claude surfaces the gap without auto-fixing.
- **Expected touches:** `tests/test_agent.py:<line-of-smoke-test>`, possibly `src/agent/tools.py:<line-of-SAFE_COMMANDS>` if the check needed tightening.

### L7 — Project exploration as code grows (OPTIONAL)

- **What you'll learn:** orient yourself once the seed shape has grown past a handful of files.
- **Put this in Claude:**
  > The codebase has grown past the seed shape. Produce a current architecture view: map modules, entry points, external dependencies, and any surprising coupling. Output a one-page summary with a Mermaid component diagram (≤10 nodes). Skip anything CLAUDE.md already says.
- **What will happen:** Claude runs the `project-exploration` skill, generates a compact summary with a diagram.
- **Expected touches:** none (read-only). Useful once the project has ≥10 files.

## §Prereq Behaviors

**`uv` missing.** Before running the test gate, check `command -v uv`. If absent:

- Print: `uv is not installed. Install with: curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh (then re-run 'uv sync && uv run pytest -q' from this project root).`
- Skip `uv sync` and `uv run pytest -q`. Do not fail the session.
- Note the skipped step in the mushi doc's "What to do next": add a bullet `Install uv, then run: uv sync && uv run pytest -q` above the `/co` line.

**`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` unset.** Do NOT block the flow. The smoke test is designed to pass without the key (constructs the agent against a mock transport). Handle it this way:

- `.env.example` lists `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=` as a placeholder.
- The mushi doc's "What to do next" mentions that live agent calls require `export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...` (in a `.env` file, which is gitignored) before running `uv run python -m src.web.app`.

## §Agent Pipeline Block

Append this block to `CLAUDE.md` when the §Init idempotency predicate reports no existing heading. **Source of truth:** `commands/onboard-project.md` § Agent Pipeline Block is the authoritative version; the block below is a verbatim mirror. If you need to change the block, change it in `commands/onboard-project.md` first, then mirror here. Both commands must produce byte-identical CLAUDE.md sections.

```markdown
## Agent Pipeline

Follow the **Understand, Plan, Verify** methodology. For multi-step work (Standard/Full tier), delegate to specialized agents in pipeline order. Each pipeline operates in an ephemeral `.ai-work/<task-slug>/` directory (deleted after use); permanent artifacts go to `.ai-state/` (committed to git).

1. **researcher** → `.ai-work/<slug>/RESEARCH_FINDINGS.md` — codebase exploration, external docs
2. **systems-architect** → `.ai-work/<slug>/SYSTEMS_PLAN.md` + ADR drafts under `.ai-state/decisions/drafts/` (promoted to stable `<NNN>-<slug>.md` at merge-to-main by the post-merge hook) + `.ai-state/ARCHITECTURE.md` (architect-facing) + `docs/architecture.md` (developer-facing)
3. **implementation-planner** → `.ai-work/<slug>/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` + `WIP.md` — step decomposition
4. **implementer** + **test-engineer** (concurrent, on disjoint file sets) → code + tests — execute steps from the plan
5. **verifier** → `.ai-work/<slug>/VERIFICATION_REPORT.md` — post-implementation review

**Independent audits.** The `sentinel` agent runs outside the pipeline and writes timestamped `.ai-state/SENTINEL_REPORT_<timestamp>.md` plus an append-only `.ai-state/SENTINEL_LOG.md`. Trigger it for ecosystem health baselines (before first ideation, after major refactors).

**From PoC to production.** The feature pipeline is one milestone of many. The full journey: baseline audit (`/sentinel`) → CI/CD setup (`cicd-engineer` agent) → deployment (`deployment` skill) → first release (`/release`) → ongoing decisions captured as ADRs in `.ai-state/decisions/` → cross-session memory in `.ai-state/memory.json` (when memory MCP is enabled).

Always include expected deliverables when delegating to an agent. The agent coordination protocol rule has full delegation checklists.
```

## §Compaction Guidance Block

Append this block to `CLAUDE.md` when the §Init idempotency predicate for `## Compaction Guidance` reports no existing heading. **Source of truth:** `commands/onboard-project.md` § Compaction Guidance Block — verbatim mirror below.

```markdown
## Compaction Guidance

When this conversation compacts, always preserve: the active pipeline stage and task slug, the current WIP step number and status, acceptance criteria from the systems plan, and the list of files modified in the current step. The Praxion `PreCompact` hook snapshots in-flight pipeline documents to `.ai-work/<slug>/PIPELINE_STATE.md` — re-read that file after compaction to restore orientation.
```

## §Behavioral Contract Block

Append this block to `CLAUDE.md` when the §Init idempotency predicate for `## Behavioral Contract` reports no existing heading. **Source of truth:** `commands/onboard-project.md` § Behavioral Contract Block — verbatim mirror below.

```markdown
## Behavioral Contract

Four non-negotiable behaviors for any agent (including Claude itself) writing, planning, or reviewing code in this project:

- **Surface Assumptions** — list assumptions before acting; ask when ambiguity could produce the wrong artifact.
- **Register Objection** — when a request violates scope, structure, or evidence, state the conflict with a reason before complying or declining. Silent agreement is a contract violation.
- **Stay Surgical** — touch only what the change requires; if scope grew, stop and re-scope instead of silently expanding.
- **Simplicity First** — prefer the smallest solution that meets the behavior; every added line, file, or dependency must earn its place.

Self-test: did I state assumptions, flag conflicts with reasons, stay inside declared scope, and choose the simplest path?
```

## §Idempotency Predicates — per-Flow-phase contracts

Per-phase predicates that govern §Flow steps. Re-running `/new-project` on a directory mid-flight (e.g., after a partial run) honors these checks so completed phases are not redone.

| Flow step | Predicate (skip if true) |
|-----------|--------------------------|
| 8 (Python `.gitignore` block) | `grep -q '^# Python$' .gitignore` AND each of the four lines (`__pycache__/`, `.venv/`, `*.egg-info/`, `.pytest_cache/`) already present |
| 10a (Agent Pipeline append) | `grep -q '^## Agent Pipeline$' CLAUDE.md` |
| 10b (Compaction Guidance append) | `grep -q '^## Compaction Guidance$' CLAUDE.md` |
| 10c (Behavioral Contract append) | `grep -q '^## Behavioral Contract$' CLAUDE.md` |

Other §Flow steps (1–7, 9, 11–13) are not idempotent in the strict sense because the seed pipeline (researcher → architect → planner → implementer + test-engineer → verifier) produces new artifacts each run. The §Guard at flow-start refuses to run on a non-greenfield directory, so re-invocation is rare; if it does happen, the user gets a Guard abort and is directed to `/onboard-project` instead.

**Smooth integration contract.** When `/new-project` finishes successfully and the user runs `/onboard-project` next (per the exit handoff recommendation), two phases of `/onboard-project` are complete no-ops because the seed pipeline already produced their outputs:

- **`/onboard-project` Phase 6 (CLAUDE.md blocks)** — all three predicates hit (Agent Pipeline, Compaction Guidance, Behavioral Contract are present from this command's Flow step 10).
- **`/onboard-project` Phase 8 (Architecture Baseline)** — the predicate `test -e .ai-state/ARCHITECTURE.md` hits because the seed pipeline's `systems-architect` (gate 4b) already produced both `.ai-state/ARCHITECTURE.md` and `docs/architecture.md`. Re-running the architect would overwrite a real-content baseline with another real-content baseline; the predicate prevents that.

The other phases of `/onboard-project` (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9) apply the surfaces this command does not — git hooks, merge drivers, `.ai-state/` skeleton (`DECISIONS_INDEX.md`, `TECH_DEBT_LEDGER.md`, `calibration_log.md`), `.gitattributes`, `.claude/settings.json` toggles, companion CLI advisories, and the verification handoff.

## Test gate

After all files are generated and before the mushi doc is finalised, run:

```
uv sync && uv run pytest -q
```

If `uv` is absent, see §Prereq Behaviors and skip gracefully. If tests fail, surface the output — do not hide a red test. The mushi doc notes the failure in "What to do next".

## Exit handoff

Stage everything (`git add -A`). Do NOT commit. Print exactly:

```
Scaffold staged. Two recommended next steps:
  1. Run /onboard-project — applies the remaining surfaces (git hooks, merge drivers, .ai-state/ skeleton, .claude/settings.json toggles, full CLAUDE.md blocks). Greenfield and existing-project paths converge here.
  2. Run /co to commit (or /cop for commit+push); both apply rules/swe/vcs/git-conventions.md automatically, so you don't hand-craft commit messages.
```

The mushi doc's "What to read next" carries the same three-step language — `/onboard-project` first (smooth integration with the existing-project path), `/co` second (commit), and a pointer to `docs/greenfield-onboarding.md` (this command's companion doc) plus `docs/existing-project-onboarding.md` (the `/onboard-project` companion).
